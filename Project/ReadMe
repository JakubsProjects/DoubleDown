Welcome to the game of DoubleDown, where you try to complete a set of four pieces that are alike.  Players take turns making moves. On 
each move your OPPONENT chooses the piece, then YOU get to place it on the board.  If you create a set of four alike when you place 
your piece, then you win! A set of four alike can be completed by using four upper case characters, four lower-case characters, four
vowels (a,e,i,o) or four consonants

The game level determines which positions can be used in completing four alike pieces.  Level one checks for four alike in every row, 
column, and diagonal.  Level two additionally checks for the pieces in the four corners as well as each cluster of four in each corner.
